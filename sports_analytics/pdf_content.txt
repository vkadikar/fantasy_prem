Loma
 
Parrots
 
(Zach,
 
league
 
champion)
 
and
 
Arnie-senal
 
(Arnav,
 
playoff
 
champion)
 
landing
 
silverware.
 
Drewyomo
 
FC
 
were
 
relegated
 
following
 
their
 
last
 
place
 
finish
 
and
 
refusal
 
to
 
complete
 
the
 
league
 
punishment.
 
1
 At  this  time  in  the  league’s  history,  having  the  best  record  at  the  end  of  the  regular  season  was  not  a  
recognized
 
accomplishment.
 
The
 
winner
 
of
 
the
 
fantasy
 
league
 
was
 
Arnav
 
(winner
 
of
 
playoff).
 
 The  2024-2025  season  saw  the  addition  of  four  new  teams  and  two  new  in-season  
tournaments.
 
For
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
silverware
 
was
 
given
 
out
 
for
 
the
 
league
 
winner
 
(Shayan
 
Hussain),
 
a
 
Champions
 
League
 
winner
 
(Varun
 
Kadikar),
 
and
 
a
 
Lingineni
 
Cup
 
winner
 
(Purvaansh
 
Lohiya).
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
season,
 
Wes
 
H00vlahan
 
and
 
their
 
manager
 
Arman
 
Hussain
 
were
 
relegated
 
from
 
the
 
league
 
due
 
to
 
inactivity
 
and
 
offensive
 
apathy.
 
Arnav
 
completed
 
the
 
iHop
 
punishment
 
and
 
secured
 
his
 
spot
 
in
 
the
 
league
 
for
 
this
 
season.
  Please  find  below  the  total  standings  across  all  seasons:  
  Important  Dates   August  6,  2025 :  Draft  day  (7PM  pacific  time  /  10PM  eastern  time  start)  August  15,  2025:  Premier  league  kickoff   Format    

After  completion  of  the  draft  on  August  6,  you  will  have  your  confirmed  17  man  squad.  Players  
in
 
your
 
squad
 
can
 
be
 
traded
 
with
 
other
 
league
 
managers
 
through
 
the
 
Fantrax
 
app
 
by
 
requesting
 
a
 
trade.
 
Furthermore,
 
you
 
can
 
continue
 
to
 
add
 
players
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
signed
 
to
 
another
 
manager’s
 
team
 
by
 
dropping
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
own
 
players
 
out
 
of
 
your
 
squad
 
and
 
into
 
the
 
free
 
agents
 
list.
 
Both
 
free
 
agents
 
and
 
trades
 
between
 
managers
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
be
 
made
 
until
 
matchweek
 
34,
 
when
 
transfers
 
are
 
entirely
 
done
 
for
 
the
 
season
 
and
 
your
 
squad
 
will
 
be
 
locked.
 
This
 
is
 
to
 
prevent
 
collusion
 
and
 
match
 
fixing
 
in
 
the
 
final
 
weeks
 
of
 
the
 
campaign
 
when
 
teams
 
may
 
be
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
results
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
finish
 
in
 
a
 
certain
 
position.
 
  The  league  will  begin  with  matchday  1  of  the  Premier  League  season,  and  continue  through  to  
matchday
 
38.
 
Each
 
week,
 
you
 
will
 
compete
 
against
 
one
 
other
 
team
 
in
 
the
 
league.
 
You
 
must
 
set
 
your
 
11
 
man
 
lineup
 
before
 
the
 
matches
 
kickoff.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
drafted
 
both
 
Haaland
 
and
 
Nicholas
 
Jackson
 
and
 
you
 
find
 
that
 
Haaland
 
is
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
starting
 
11
 
for
 
City
 
while
 
Jackson
 
is
 
in
 
Chelsea’s
 
starting
 
11,
 
you
 
may
 
elect
 
to
 
put
 
Haaland
 
on
 
your
 
bench
 
for
 
this
 
match
 
week
 
and
 
start
 
Jackson
 
on
 
your
 
team.
 
You
 
will
 
get
 
points
 
for
 
actions
 
that
 
your
 
starting
 
11
 
completes
 
in
 
real
 
life
 
(for
 
example,
 
9
 
points
 
if
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
players
 
scores,
 
6
 
points
 
for
 
a
 
clean
 
sheet
 
for
 
defenders,
 
etc).
 
Once
 
the
 
10
 
fixtures
 
in
 
real
 
life
 
are
 
complete,
 
each
 
team
 
that
 
has
 
accumulated
 
more
 
points
 
for
 
the
 
week
 
than
 
their
 
counterpart
 
will
 
receive
 
three
 
points
 
towards
 
the
 
overall
 
league
 
standings.
